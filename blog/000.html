## 000 | 03/20/2025 | Zero finished projects

For pretty much my entire life I have a problem with finishing things. Every time
I start something, I stop doing that after a few days or months. Never finishing 
anything.

I want to change that, I already have a somewhat working version of my strategy game
in Unity that I started in December 2024. January was very good, I worked for 291h
total, and about 130h on this game. I think it was like that, because I decided to
work minimum 4 hours a day on that project, and it kept me going.

However, then came the February, and my fire for making game slowly went away.
I started thinking about writing something in C, rather than Unity C#, I felt 
nothing, no emotions, no nothing. Maybe that's because I was saing to myself, that 
I MUST finish that game, not that I WANT to finish it. And deep inside there is a 
part of me that relly wants to do that, I just fall for the trap of "new shiny 
object" and easly distract myself with other projects, when difficulty increases.
Mybe I'm just too weak mentally. Maybe I'm doing too big projects. Maybe...

I need to stick to ONE thing, and then I think that it will pay off. Every time when
I was doing just ONE thing for several days, my productivity was at all time high
and I done a lot of stuff. And I need to revisit that place.
