        <h2>Meaning of life
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwDWZoETk4&ab_channel=MontyPython"> 42 
        </a></h2>
        So, at the age around 14, one night I couldn't sleep and went outside at 3AM. 
        I was thinking about meaning of this world. 
        While looking at the stars I started asking questions. 
        Why am I here? What is the meaning of my life? What do I want to do in life?
        And at that time my answer to that questions was something like this:
        <div class="quote"><i>
        "There is no specific meaning that I can be aware of at the moment.
        So the only think I can do about it is to be happy and satisfied with my life.
        I don't want to have regrets on my death bed. 
        And on top of that I want to have positive impact on happiness of other people
        and make this world a better place."
        </i></div>
        <br>
        Since then the general idea stayed the same. 
        <br>
        I think there is no significant meaning to life, 
        but it is worth living, just to experience it and be in this world doing 
        interesting things. Couse, why not? If I have to choose between nothing and something, 
        I prefere something, because it is more interesting to me. 
        I think, that unpredictability and experiences are the essence of everything.
        <br>
        <br>
        Because If there is no surprise, no challange, no nothing... 
        It is pretty boring and sad life tbh.
        And nobody wants to live a boring life, right? 
        (...) right? well probably some people actually do, but this is not my cup of coffee.
        <br>
        <br>
        So to make sense of all of that, one needs to make up his own meaning.
        Whether it's trying to understand this world by learning and asking questions, 
        (e.g. physicists are kinda like that), or just to have family and raise kids.
        It really doesn't matter all that much. The importatnt part is that you are
        making your meaning with respect to what you really want from life.
