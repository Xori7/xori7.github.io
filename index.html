        <h1>The Reason Part</h1>
        In recent months and years I've been thinking about making a place for my thoughts, knowledge and ideas.
        And I have this dream of a Xori's place.
        <br>
        <br>A place, where I can express myself, write about technology, philosophy, games and other stuff...
        <br>A place, where I can test my knowledge by trying to explain different topics...
        <br>A place, where I can store my ideas and projects...
        <br>
        I could use notebook, some fancy note taking app, make videos and keep all of that in my own space just for me.
        <br>
        I tried...
        <br>
        and never managed to do the damn thing for more than a day or two.
        <br>
        So this is my newest approach to turn the Xori's place into reality. Website that you are looking at right now.
